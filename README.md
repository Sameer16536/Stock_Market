# Real-Time Stock Market Trading App

This is a real-time stock market trading application, inspired by platforms like Zerodha, Groww, and Upstox. The app is designed to provide real-time stock price updates, enable trading, and provide insights into market data using APIs and WebSocket connections.

## Architecture Overview

The system architecture is designed to be scalable, robust, and optimized for real-time updates. Below is the detailed architecture:

---

### **1. Frontend (React + TailwindCSS)**

- **Purpose**: Provides the user interface for real-time stock trading and data visualization.
- **Features**:
  - Real-time stock price updates using WebSockets.
  - Interactive charts and graphs (e.g., using D3.js, Chart.js, or Recharts).
  - Trading dashboard with buy/sell functionality.
  - Custom filters for stocks (e.g., by sector, stock performance).

---

### **2. Backend (Node.js + Express)**

- **Purpose**: Handles business logic, WebSocket connections, and database operations.
- **Features**:
  - Real-time WebSocket server for live updates.
  - REST/GraphQL APIs for historical data, user profiles, and transaction history.
  - Integration with third-party APIs and scraping mechanisms.
  - Authentication and authorization (JWT, OAuth).

---

### **3. Cache Layer (Redis)**

- **Purpose**: Serves real-time stock data and offloads frequent queries from the database.
- **Features**:
  - Stores live stock prices with TTL (Time-to-Live).
  - Used for rate-limiting and session management.

---

### **4. Database Layer (PostgreSQL + Time-Series Database)**

- **Purpose**: Persists historical data and transactional records.
- **Features**:
  - **PostgreSQL** for storing user data, trades, and application metadata.

---

### **5. Scraping/Data Layer**

- **Purpose**: Fetches real-time stock market data using WebSocket APIs or web scraping.
- **Features**:
  - **Puppeteer** or **Playwright** for scraping data from NSE/BSE.
  - **WebSocket connection** to third-party APIs for real-time data updates.
  - Data aggregation and cleansing.

---

### **6. Message Queue (Kafka/RabbitMQ)**

- **Purpose**: Handles real-time updates and ensures reliable event processing.
- **Features**:
  - Processes real-time stock data from the scraper.
  - Pushes updates to WebSocket clients.
  - Aggregates data for storage in the database.

---

### **7. Load Balancer (NGINX)**

- **Purpose**: Distributes traffic to backend services and handles static file serving.
- **Features**:
  - Routes WebSocket connections and HTTP requests.
  - Serves static files (e.g., images, JavaScript, CSS).
  - Implements security measures like IP whitelisting, rate-limiting, and SSL termination.

---

### **8. Deployment and Orchestration (Docker + Kubernetes)**

- **Purpose**: Containerizes the application for easier deployment and scaling.
- **Features**:
  - **Docker** containers for all services (backend, frontend, Redis, scraping, etc.).
  - **Kubernetes** for auto-scaling, service discovery, and fault tolerance.

### **Data Flow and Real-Time Updates**

1. **Frontend** connects to the **backend** using WebSockets to receive real-time stock price updates.
2. The **backend** fetches live data from third-party APIs or uses **scraping** mechanisms to obtain stock prices.
3. The **scraper** uses **Puppeteer/Playwright** to collect data from **NSE/BSE** websites (with legal compliance).
4. The backend pushes data to **Redis** for caching and uses **Redis Pub/Sub** for real-time updates to connected clients.
5. All historical and transactional data is stored in **PostgreSQL** and **Time-Series Database** (TimescaleDB).
6. **NGINX** acts as a reverse proxy, load balancer, and static file server for the backend and frontend.

---

### **Key Features**

1. **Real-Time Price Updates**: Stock prices are updated instantly using WebSockets or Redis Pub/Sub.
2. **Trading Dashboard**: Users can buy and sell stocks with real-time price locking.
3. **User Authentication**: Secure login and role-based access.
4. **Paper Trading**: Practice trades using virtual money.
5. **Data Visualizations**: Real-time candlestick charts and technical indicators.
6. **Alerts**: Set up price alerts and trading signals.

### **Benefits of Using NGINX**

- **Load Balancing**: Even with a single backend instance, NGINX can efficiently handle incoming requests and future scalability.
- **Rate Limiting**: NGINX helps prevent abuse by limiting request rates, especially for scraping.
- **SSL Termination**: NGINX handles SSL/TLS encryption, securing connections for web clients.
- **Caching**: NGINX can cache static content, reducing load on the backend and improving performance.
- **Security**: It provides a layer of protection against DDoS attacks and unauthorized access.

---

### **How to Set Up NGINX as a Proxy for Scraping**

1. **Rate Limiting**: NGINX can enforce rate limits to avoid hitting scraping targets too frequently.
   - Example:
   ```nginx
   limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=mylimit:10m rate=5r/s;
   server {
       location / {
           limit_req zone=mylimit burst=10 nodelay;
           proxy_pass http://scraper_backend;
       }
   }


2. **Caching**: NGINX can cache specific responses from scraped data to reduce the frequency of scraping requests.
3. **Load Balancing**: Use NGINX to balance requests between multiple scraping instances, if necessary.
4. **IP Rotation**: Proxy requests through different IP addresses or proxies to avoid getting blocked by the target website.

---

### **Database Setup**

1. **PostgreSQL**: Stores user profiles, trades, and other metadata.
2. **TimescaleDB (for time-series data)**: Stores stock prices, trading volumes, and other historical data efficiently.

---

### **Deployment Considerations**

- **Docker**: Package all services (frontend, backend, Redis, PostgreSQL, NGINX, etc.) into Docker containers for easy deployment and scaling.
- **Kubernetes**: For managing multiple instances, auto-scaling, and fault tolerance.
- **CI/CD**: Automate deployment with GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI.

---

### **Future Improvements**

1. **AI/ML Integration**:
   - Sentiment analysis for stocks based on news.
   - Predictive stock price models using machine learning.

2. **Mobile Application**:
   - Use React Native to extend the platform to mobile users.

3. **Advanced Trading Features**:
   - Implement margin trading, stop-loss orders, etc.

4. **Security Improvements**:
   - Two-factor authentication (2FA) for user logins.
   - Audit logs for trade activities.
