# Real-Time Stock Market Trading App

## **Project Overview**
This project is a real-time stock market trading application for Indian stock exchanges (BSE/NSE). It allows users to view live stock prices, manage portfolios, simulate trades, and set alerts. The app is designed for scalability, low latency, and future enhancements.

---

## **Features**
- **Real-Time Stock Prices**: Live updates of stock prices using WebSocket and Redis caching.
- **Portfolio Management**: Track current holdings, net worth, and profit/loss.
- **Simulated Trading**: Buy and sell stocks with virtual funds.
- **Watchlists**: Add and monitor favorite stocks.
- **Alerts**: Receive notifications for price thresholds or percentage changes.
- **Analytics and Reports**: Daily, weekly, and monthly performance reports.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and session management using JWT.
- **Admin Panel**: Manage users and monitor system health (future feature).

## **Architecture**

### **Frontend**
- **Framework**: React
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Features**:
  - Real-time dashboards
  - Responsive and interactive UIs
  - Watchlist and portfolio management components

### **Backend**
- **Framework**: Node.js with Express.js (or NestJS for modularity)
- **Features**:
  - WebSocket server for real-time data
  - REST APIs for user authentication, portfolio, and trading operations
  - Scheduled scraping tasks for stock data
  
### **Database Layer**
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL
  - User data, portfolio, transaction history, and analytics.
- **Cache Layer**: Redis
  - Real-time stock price caching and WebSocket pub/sub.

### **Proxy and Load Balancer**
- **Nginx**
  - Reverse proxy for routing requests
  - Load balancing for WebSocket connections (future use)
  - Proxy for scraping tasks

### **Containerization**
- **Docker**
  - Isolate services like Node.js, Redis, and PostgreSQL
  - Consistent deployment environments

### **Web Scraping**
- **Tools**: Puppeteer/Playwright
  - Scrapes live stock prices and metadata from public NSE/BSE websites.

### **Task Queue**
- **Bull.js**
  - Manages scraping schedules and background tasks.

## **Backend Workflow**
### **1. Data Ingestion**
- Scrape data using Puppeteer/Playwright or fetch via free APIs (e.g., Alpha Vantage).
- Clean and validate data.
- Cache in Redis for real-time updates.
- Persist in PostgreSQL for historical records.

### **2. Real-Time Data Delivery**
- Use WebSocket to push live stock prices to the frontend.
- Subscribe to Redis channels for efficient data broadcasting.

### **3. User Authentication**
- Authenticate users using JWT tokens.
- Secure sensitive endpoints with token validation.

### **4. Trading Operations**
- Validate trade requests (stock symbol, quantity, user balance).
- Simulate order execution.
- Update portfolio and transaction history.

### **5. Alerts and Notifications**
- Monitor stock prices for user-defined thresholds.
- Send push notifications or emails when conditions are met.

### **6. Analytics and Reports**
- Aggregate historical data for daily, weekly, and monthly reports.
- Use worker threads to offload heavy computations.

## **Frontend Workflow**
1. **Landing Page**: User login/signup.
2. **Dashboard**:
   - Display live stock prices.
   - Portfolio overview.
   - Watchlist.
3. **Trading Modal**:
   - Place buy/sell orders.
   - Confirm transactions.
4. **Reports Page**:
   - Download historical performance reports.
5. **Alert Settings**:
   - Configure price/volume alerts.

---

## **Deployment Plan**
1. **Local Development**:
   - Use Docker Compose for setting up services (Node.js, Redis, PostgreSQL).
2. **Staging Environment**:
   - Deploy on a cloud provider (AWS, GCP, or Azure).
   - Use Nginx for reverse proxy and static file serving.
3. **Production**:
   - Scale backend and WebSocket services using Kubernetes.
   - Implement Redis clustering for high availability.
   - Enable SSL using Nginx.
